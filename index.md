# <a name="description">Objectives</a>

  This course enables the fundamentals of electrostatics, magneto-statics and electromagnetic fields. It defines capacitors, inductors and resistors in terms of primary electric and magnetic quantities. It also emphasizes the physical understanding and practical applications of electromagnetics in electrical engineering. 

## <a name="outcomes">Course Outcomes</a>

After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:

A6207.1. Apply orthogonal coordinate systems and physical laws to determine electric and magnetic field components.

A6207.2. Analyze electric and magnetic fields in static and time varying fields.

A6207.3. Examine Maxwell’s equations for static and time varying fields.

A6207.4. Evaluate the capacitance, inductance and magnetic force for geometrical conductors in electromagnetic fields.

# Coursework

Inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24 hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and exceptional circumstances. The late assignments will receive at most half credit.
